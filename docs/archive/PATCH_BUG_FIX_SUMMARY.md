# Patch Application Bug Fix Summary

## Issue Description

**Problem**: Nova CI-Rescue was failing with "PATCH ERROR - Failed to apply patch" when attempting to fix tests, even though the Planner, Actor, and Critic stages were working correctly.

**Root Cause**: The patch application was failing due to content mismatches between what the generated patch expected to find and what was actually in the files. This occurred when:

1. Tests were already fixed from a previous run but Nova still detected them as failing
2. The LLM generated patches based on the assumption of broken code when the code was already correct
3. The patch application had insufficient error handling and diagnostics

## Investigation Process

1. **Examined the test file** (`demo_test_repo/test_failures.py`):

   - Found tests marked as "FIXED by Nova" with correct assertions
   - Yet Nova was still detecting 3 failing tests

2. **Analyzed patch application code** (`src/nova/tools/fs.py`):

   - Found minimal error handling
   - No validation for empty patches
   - Limited context matching capabilities
   - Poor diagnostic output

3. **Identified the failure pattern**:
   - LLM generates patch expecting: `assert result == 5` → `assert result == 4`
   - Actual file already has: `assert result == 4`
   - Patch fails due to context mismatch

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling (`src/nova/tools/fs.py`)

```python
# Added specific exception handling
try:
    # Validate the diff is not empty
    if not diff_text or not diff_text.strip():
        if verbose:
            print("Error: Empty patch provided")
        return False, []

    # Apply the patch
    changed_files = apply_unified_diff(repo_root, diff_text)

    # Check if any files were actually changed
    if not changed_files:
        if verbose:
            print("Warning: No files were changed by the patch (may already be applied)")
        return False, []

except ValueError as e:
    if verbose:
        print(f"Error: Invalid patch format - {e}")
    return False, []
except PermissionError as e:
    if verbose:
        print(f"Error: Permission denied - {e}")
    return False, []
except RuntimeError as e:
    if verbose:
        print(f"Error: Runtime error - {e}")
    return False, []
except Exception as e:
    if verbose:
        import traceback
        print(f"Error applying patch: {e}")
        print(f"Patch content (first 500 chars):\n{diff_text[:500]}")
        traceback.print_exc()
    return False, []
```

### 2. Improved Context Matching (`_build_content_from_hunks`)

Added fuzzy matching to handle slight context differences:

```python
# Track if we successfully matched context
context_matched = True
hunk_lines = list(hunk)

# First pass: check if context lines match
for line in hunk_lines:
    if getattr(line, "is_context", False) or getattr(line, "is_removed", False):
        val = getattr(line, "value", str(line)[1:] if str(line) else "")
        if temp_idx < len(lines_prev):
            if lines_prev[temp_idx].rstrip() != val.rstrip():
                context_matched = False
                break

# If context doesn't match, try to find where the hunk should apply
if not context_matched and lines_prev:
    # Search within ±10 lines for matching context
    for search_idx in range(max(0, idx - 10), min(len(lines_prev), idx + 10)):
        # Try to match the hunk at this position
        if match_found:
            idx = search_idx
            context_matched = True
            break
```

### 3. Better Diagnostic Output (`src/nova/nodes/apply_patch.py`)

```python
if self.verbose:
    console.print(f"[cyan]Applying patch (step {step_number})...[/cyan]")
    # Show first few lines of patch for debugging
    patch_lines = patch_text.split('\n')[:10]
    console.print("[dim]Patch preview:[/dim]")
    for line in patch_lines:
        if line.startswith('+++') or line.startswith('---'):
            console.print(f"[dim]  {line}[/dim]")
        elif line.startswith('+'):
            console.print(f"[green]  {line}[/green]")
        elif line.startswith('-'):
            console.print(f"[red]  {line}[/red]")

# On failure, provide helpful diagnostics
if not success:
    console.print(f"[red]✗ Failed to apply patch (step {step_number})[/red]")
    console.print("[yellow]Possible reasons:[/yellow]")
    console.print("  • File content doesn't match patch expectations")
    console.print("  • Tests may already be fixed")
    console.print("  • Invalid patch format")
    console.print("[dim]Run with --verbose for more details[/dim]")
```

## Test Coverage

Created comprehensive test script (`test_patch_fix.py`) covering:

1. ✅ Apply patch to matching content
2. ✅ Handle already-fixed content gracefully
3. ✅ Fuzzy matching for slight context differences
4. ✅ Reject empty patches
5. ✅ Create new files via patch

## Additional Files Created

1. **`demo_test_repo/test_actual_failures.py`**: Test file with actual failures for proper testing
2. **`test_patch_fix.py`**: Comprehensive test script for patch application
3. **This summary document**: Complete documentation of the fix

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

1. **Pre-patch Validation**: Check if tests are actually failing before generating patches
2. **Patch Retry Logic**: If a patch fails, try alternative approaches
3. **Content Verification**: Compare expected vs actual file content before patching
4. **Incremental Patches**: Apply patches line-by-line for better error isolation
5. **Rollback Mechanism**: Already implemented but could be enhanced with savepoints

## How to Test the Fix

```bash
# Run the test script
python test_patch_fix.py

# Test with actual failing tests
nova fix demo_test_repo --verbose

# Test with the new test file
nova fix demo_test_repo/test_actual_failures.py --verbose
```

## Result

The patch application is now more robust with:

- ✅ Better error handling and reporting
- ✅ Validation for empty/invalid patches
- ✅ Fuzzy context matching for slight differences
- ✅ Detailed diagnostic output in verbose mode
- ✅ Graceful handling of already-fixed content

The fixes ensure that Nova CI-Rescue can:

1. Detect and report patch application failures clearly
2. Handle cases where tests are already fixed
3. Apply patches even with slight context differences
4. Provide actionable error messages for debugging
