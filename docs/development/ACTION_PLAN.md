# üéØ Nova CI-Rescue - Your Action Plan

## ‚úÖ What I've Done For You

### 1. **Linear Project Created**
- **Project**: "üöÄ CI Auto-Rescue MVP Completion" 
- **URL**: https://linear.app/nova-solve/project/ci-auto-rescue-mvp-completion-ab21f118135a
- **10 Issues Created** with clear priorities:
  - 3 P0 (Critical blockers)
  - 5 P1 (High priority)  
  - 2 P2 (Medium priority)

### 2. **Documentation Created**
- **IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - Complete technical roadmap
- **env.example** - Environment configuration template
- **ACTION_PLAN.md** - This file, your executive summary

### 3. **Analysis Completed**
- Identified all missing components
- Prioritized tasks by importance
- Created 8-day implementation timeline
- Defined success criteria

## üö® Your Immediate Next Steps (Do These NOW)

### Step 1: Create the CLI Module (30 minutes)
The most critical missing piece. Without this, nothing works.

```bash
# Create the file
touch src/nova/cli.py

# Copy the skeleton from IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
# Test it works:
nova --help
```

### Step 2: Check Your Linear Tasks
1. Go to: https://linear.app/nova-solve/project/ci-auto-rescue-mvp-completion-ab21f118135a
2. Start with issue NOV-693 (Create CLI)
3. Move it to "In Progress"
4. Complete it before moving to next task

### Step 3: Follow The Plan
Work through tasks in this order:
1. **P0 tasks first** (CLI, Agent, Test Context)
2. **P1 tasks next** (Telemetry, Pytest, LLM)
3. **P2 tasks last** (Docs, GitHub Action)

## üìã Your Task List (In Priority Order)

### üî¥ Critical - Do Today
- [ ] NOV-693: Create CLI entry point
- [ ] NOV-694: Implement agent workflow  
- [ ] NOV-695: Auto-inject failing tests

### üü° High Priority - Do This Week
- [ ] NOV-696: Complete telemetry
- [ ] NOV-697: Add pytest integration
- [ ] NOV-698: Implement LLM clients
- [ ] NOV-700: Create test repository
- [ ] NOV-702: Build evaluation suite

### üü¢ Medium Priority - Do Next Week
- [ ] NOV-699: Write documentation
- [ ] NOV-701: GitHub Action workflow

## üîç Design Review (DR) Audit Process

**NEW**: After completing each milestone, conduct a mandatory Design Review audit:

### DR Audit Checkpoints
- **After Milestone A** (Local E2E): OS-849 - Technical architecture, test coverage, code quality
- **After Milestone B** (CI & Telemetry): OS-850 - Telemetry review, package audit, CI validation  
- **After Milestone C** (GitHub Action): OS-851 - Security review, GitHub best practices, safety validation
- **After Milestone D** (Demo & Release): OS-852 - End-to-end review, documentation, release readiness

### DR Audit Process
1. Complete all tasks in milestone
2. Run DR audit checklist (docs/11-dr-audit-checklist.md)
3. Document findings and create follow-up issues
4. Get sign-off before proceeding to next milestone
5. Track metrics: issues found, resolution time, quality improvements

### Why DR Audits Matter
- **Quality Gates**: Ensure each milestone meets standards before moving forward
- **Early Detection**: Catch issues before they compound in later stages
- **Documentation**: Create audit trail for compliance and learning
- **Team Alignment**: Ensure everyone agrees on completion criteria

## üîë Environment Setup

Your `.env` file should look like this (you already have the keys configured!):

```env
# You already have these configured ‚úÖ
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-key-here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-actual-key-here

# Optional tweaks
NOVA_MAX_ITERS=6
NOVA_DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

## üìä Success Metrics

You'll know you're done when:
1. ‚úÖ `nova fix /path/to/repo` runs without errors
2. ‚úÖ Tests go from red to green automatically
3. ‚úÖ Success rate ‚â•70% on 4 test repos
4. ‚úÖ Telemetry logs show complete execution
5. ‚úÖ Can handle Ctrl+C gracefully

## ‚è± Time Estimates

Based on the analysis, here's how long each phase should take:

- **Today (Day 1)**: Get CLI and LLM clients working (7 hours)
- **Tomorrow (Day 2)**: Build agent implementation (8 hours)
- **Day 3**: Integration and testing (6 hours)
  - **+ DR Audit A**: 4 hours (technical review, test coverage, code quality)
- **Day 4-5**: Validation and eval suite (12 hours)
  - **+ DR Audit B**: 4 hours (telemetry, packaging, CI validation)
- **Week 2**: GitHub integration and polish
  - **+ DR Audit C**: 4 hours (security, GitHub best practices, safety)
  - **+ DR Audit D**: 7 hours (final review, documentation, release readiness)

**Total MVP Time**: ~40 hours of focused work
**Total DR Audit Time**: ~19 hours across all milestones
**Grand Total**: ~59 hours including quality gates

## üéØ Definition of Done

The MVP is complete when you can:

1. Install Nova with `pip install -e .`
2. Run `nova fix sample-repo/` 
3. Watch it automatically:
   - Detect failing tests
   - Generate fixes
   - Apply patches
   - Verify tests pass
4. See detailed logs in `telemetry/`
5. Achieve ‚â•70% success rate

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start Small**: Get one test fixing before trying complex scenarios
2. **Use Cheap Models**: Start with gpt-4o-mini for development
3. **Check Telemetry**: Your answers are in the logs
4. **Commit Often**: Make small commits as you progress
5. **Test Locally**: Don't push to GitHub until local works

## üöÄ Quick Commands

```bash
# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Run on a test repo
nova fix ./test-repo --verbose

# Check telemetry
ls -la telemetry/*/trace.jsonl

# Run evaluation suite
nova eval --repos eval-config.yaml

# Clean up after testing
git checkout main && git branch -D nova-fix-*
```

## üìû When You're Stuck

1. Check `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for technical details
2. Review the Linear issues for acceptance criteria
3. Look at telemetry logs for error details
4. Reference existing code in `src/nova/tools/` for patterns

## üèÅ Let's Go!

You have everything you need:
- ‚úÖ Clear task list in Linear
- ‚úÖ Technical implementation guide
- ‚úÖ Environment already configured
- ‚úÖ Prioritized action items

**Your mission**: Get that first test from red to green automatically.

Start with NOV-693. The clock is ticking! üïê

*Remember: You already have OpenAI and Anthropic keys configured. The foundation (config, telemetry, tools) is solid. You just need to build the agent on top!*
