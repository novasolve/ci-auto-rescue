# Enhanced PR Generator Implementation

Based on your comprehensive guide, I've enhanced the PR generation feature in Nova CI-Rescue to follow all the best practices and specifications you outlined. Here's what's been implemented:

## Key Enhancements

### 1. **Context-Rich GPT-5 Prompts**

The PR generator now includes all three key pieces of context you specified:

- **Final Patch Diff**: Automatically retrieves the combined diff using `git diff main...HEAD`
- **Reasoning Logs**: Extracts AI reasoning from Nova's telemetry (planner approach, critic approvals)
- **Test Summary**: Detailed list of initially failing tests with error snippets

### 2. **Professional Prompt Template**

Implemented your exact prompt structure:

```
TASK: Write a concise pull request title and a detailed pull request description...

FORMAT:
Title: <one-line PR title summarizing the change>

<Multiple lines of PR description in Markdown>

GUIDELINES for the PR description:
- Start with problem and solution at high level
- Reference specific functions/files
- Use sections: ## Summary, ## What was fixed, ## Changes made, ## Test results
- Professional tone, bullet points for clarity
```

### 3. **Git CLI Integration (Option A)**

As recommended, using Git CLI and GitHub CLI (`gh`) for PR creation:

- Checks for `gh` installation
- Verifies GitHub authentication
- Handles missing git remotes gracefully
- Creates PR with generated title and description

### 4. **Enhanced Error Handling**

Multiple layers of fallbacks:

- If GPT-5 fails â†’ uses templated PR description
- If no git remote â†’ provides clear error message
- If `gh` not installed â†’ suggests installation command
- If PR creation fails â†’ preserves branch for manual PR

### 5. **Safety Features**

- Only runs after all tests pass
- Preserves fix branch when PR is created
- Adds automation footer to all PRs
- Provides comprehensive logging

## Implementation Details

### Context Gathering

```python
# 1. Get combined diff
final_diff = self._get_combined_diff()  # git diff main...HEAD

# 2. Extract reasoning from telemetry
reasoning_logs = []
telemetry_dir = Path(repo_path) / ".nova"
trace_file = run_dirs[0] / "trace.jsonl"
# Parses planner_complete and critic_approved events

# 3. Format test details
Initially failing tests: 3 tests were failing:
- `test_addition` in tests/test_calculator.py: assert -1 == 5
- `test_multiplication` in tests/test_calculator.py: assert 7 == 12
- `test_division_by_zero` in tests/test_calculator.py: ZeroDivisionError
```

### GPT-5 Configuration

- Uses `temperature=1` (only supported value for GPT-5)
- Uses `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens`
- Chat Completions API (not Responses API for simplicity)
- Automatic fallback if API fails

### PR Creation Flow

1. **Success Detection**: Only runs when `state.final_status == "success"`
2. **Branch Preservation**: Doesn't delete branch if PR is created
3. **Comprehensive Context**: Passes all patches, test info, and execution time
4. **Human-Readable Output**: Shows PR title and truncated description in console

## Example Output

When Nova successfully fixes tests, you'll see:

```
âœ… Success! Changes saved to branch: nova-fix/20250820_082509

PR Title: Fix calculator operations: addition, multiplication, and division handling

PR Description:
## Summary
This PR fixes three failing calculator tests by correcting arithmetic operations in the calculator module...

ðŸŽ‰ Pull Request created successfully!

```

## Usage

The PR generation is fully integrated into Nova's CLI workflow:

```bash
cd ci-auto-rescue-v0.1.0-alpha
PYTHONPATH=./src python -m nova.cli fix demo_workspace --max-iters 2
```

After fixing tests, Nova will:

1. Generate a comprehensive diff
2. Extract reasoning from its decision logs
3. Call GPT-5 with structured prompt
4. Create PR via GitHub CLI
5. Preserve the branch for review

## Benefits

- **Zero Manual Work**: From failing tests to ready-to-review PR
- **Context-Aware**: PR description explains the "why" not just "what"
- **Professional Quality**: Follows PR best practices automatically
- **Safe Integration**: Human review still required before merge
- **Transparent**: All reasoning and changes documented

This implementation follows all the recommendations from your guide while keeping the code maintainable and the workflow smooth!
