"""
Nova CI-Rescue E2E Smoke Test Script.

Assumptions:
- Running inside a virtual environment with Nova CI-Rescue installed (providing the `nova` CLI).
- An OpenAI API key is set in the environment (OPENAI_API_KEY) for the real LLM agent.
- A demo repository folder named 'demo_test_repo' is present, initialized as a git repo with intentional test failures.

This script will:
1. Verify that the environment is correctly set up (Nova installed, API key present, demo repo exists).
2. Run the tests in the demo repo to confirm the number of failing tests (initial state).
3. Invoke `nova fix` on the repo to attempt to automatically fix the failing tests.
4. Capture Nova's output logs to a file (demo_test_repo/nova_fix_run.log).
5. After Nova completes, run the tests again to check if all failures were resolved.
6. Print a summary of the results (initial vs final failures, success/failure status).
7. Optionally clean up the git branch that Nova created for the fixes (if the run was successful).

Note: The Nova fix run is limited to 3 iterations and 5 minutes for this smoke test.
